            <div>
                <p>Originating from Muar, Mee Bandung is a must-try local delight for its unique and mildly spicy taste. Several food stalls serve this special dish, but most people believe that the cook at Abu Bakar Hanipah has mastered the art of Mee Bandung. Their Mee Bandung has a rich and thick prawn flavor. The combination of their specially made sambal, shrimps, cuttlefish, and beef results in this savory and slightly overpowering taste that will linger long in your taste buds.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Occupying three shophouses in Muar, it’s hard to imagine that Muar Soup House was once only a small pedicab stall selling various soups at the roadside. However, what’s not changing is that beef and mutton soup are still their major draw. The humble bowl of soup is overloaded with mutton or beef according to what you order, and you wouldn’t find any gamey taste of raw meat. The soup will exceed your expectations and be robust, thick, and give off a slightly herbal smell.</p>
