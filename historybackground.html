        <h2>Early beginning of Muar, Johor</h2>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph">
            <img src="Picture/MuarMap.png" width="300" height="300">
            <p>Muar, historically known as Bandar Maharani, is one of the oldest towns in Malaysia, with roots dating back to the 14th century. It has a rich history of early Malay kingdoms, colonial influences, and significant regional trade and political events.</p>
        </div>
        
       
        <h2>Historical Highlights</h2>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph">
            <img src="Picture/MuarHistory.jpg" width="300" height="300">
            <p>Muar's history is believed to predate the Malacca Empire, although much of its early history remains undocumented. A notable record from 1361 mentions Muar as part of the Majapahit Empire. Additionally, Parameswara, the founder of the Malacca Empire, is believed to have established a settlement in Pagoh, Ulu Muar, before moving on to Malacca. Muar also holds historical importance as the location of the only known tomb of Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah I (14771488) of the Malacca Sultanate, which suffered damage during the Portuguese conquest.</p>

        <h2>Role in Colonial Conflicts</h2>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph">
            <img src="Picture/MuarHistory2.jpeg" width="300" height="300">
            <p>During the Portuguese era, Muar was fortified with 'Fortaleza de Muar' to defend against Dutch and Acehnese attacks. This highlights Muar's strategic importance in the region's colonial history.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Muarâ€™s Sovereign Period</h2>
        <div class="boxed-paragraph">
            <img src="Picture/SultanAli.jpg" width="300" height="300">
            <p>In the mid-19th century, Muar briefly became an independent and sovereign state under Sultan Ali (18551877). This period was marked by the agreement between the British in Singapore and Sultan Ali, which handed control of Johor (excluding Muar) to Dato' Temenggong Daing Ibrahim. Sultan Ali's reign ended with his death in 1877, after which Muar was incorporated into Johor province. Muar was later named Bandar Maharani by Maharaja Abu Bakar in 1884, reflecting its status as an important administrative centre.</p>
